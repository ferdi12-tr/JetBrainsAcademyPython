# Text Generator

### About
Machine learning is getting crazy smart these days. You've probably read texts or scripts written by machine learning algorithms, 
some of them even mimicking styles of certain people! If you ever wondered how it works and what are the secrets behind machine learning, 
this project is for you! You will have a chance to understand and implement a simple text generator using Markov chains.

### Stage 1: Preprocess the test corpus
### Stage 2: Break the dataset into bigrams
### Stage 3: Create a Markov chain model
### Stage 4: Generate random text
### Stage 5: Generate full sentences
### Stage 6: Generate sentences based on trigrams
